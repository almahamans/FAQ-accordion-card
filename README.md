## Description
I did this project as applying for a challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges).
## Languages 
HTML, css and JS.
I used Flexbox for design, svg pics and create media queries to make the page responsive also I used style.display in JS to make the answers hidden and show.
## Resorces
[W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp). 
### Thoughts
I found this challenge helpful in applying JS and using Flexbox and applying user interface detailes like font size for each screen.
